## Report

This project involved building a simple Java console application to track time spent on sports activities. I faced challenges while setting up the Jenkins pipeline, specifically with Docker image creation due to missing credentials. I resolved this by using a credentials plugin in Jenkins.

Another challenge was running the Docker container in a Linux VM, as I initially had issues with Docker not being installed properly. After reinstalling Docker and configuring the correct permissions, I was able to successfully pull and run the container in the VM.

Overall, the project enhanced my understanding of CI/CD pipelines and Dockerization.
